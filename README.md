# Weather App

In this weather app, you have a view of the weather in my favorite cities.

## The problem

I started to understand the best way to fetch the data and how to print the information.

I have used regular js methods and techniques such as:

- Fetch data
- Arrow functions
- if statements
- for each loop
- array and object manipulation

I have decided to replace the way to select the list of cities creating a modal over the name of the city, in this way the data is loaded and deleted when i choose a city from the list.

To solve this approach i have to create a generic fuction to call the fectches when i choose the city.

If i would have more time i would:

- add the Geolocation API
